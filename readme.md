# Fruit Basket Sorter Game üçéüçåüçá

Fruit Basket Sorter is a C++ terminal game where players must catch falling fruits and sort them into the correct baskets. Test your reflexes, accuracy, and timing as you progress through increasingly difficult levels. Earn achievements, activate power-ups, and compete for the highest score.

This project marks my first experience developing a C++ application. Before this, I had no prior C++ programming experience. The goal was to build a functional game to solidify my understanding of C++ concepts.

**Important Note:**  
Currently on V1.0, this game is only compatible with Linux systems. Windows support is planned for future releases, along with a graphical user interface (GUI) to enhance gameplay.
